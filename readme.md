# Linear Models

In this repository there are results of my work during the university course of linear models. The main goal was to learn about the linear regression model and learn how to choose the right model and then estimate its parameters, translate statistical results into scientific conclusions, prepare a professional data analysis report for non-specialists. Each directory is about different list of exercises. In all directories there is file Rmd and results.
